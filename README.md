Hi. My name is Saeid. I am a PhD student studying Systems Engineering at Stevens. My research and educational plans involve developing and solving optimization models for power system problems. In particular, I am interested in solving the complex AC optimal power flow problem using advanced algorithms that can handle non-convexity and scale to large real-world systems. I am also interested in applied AI in areas like healthcare and management.
For my coursework, I had these classes: 
SYS 710 - Research Methodologies
SYS 684 - Systems Thinking
SYS 660 - Decision and Risk Analysis
SYS 650 - System Architecture & Design
EE 590 - Smart Grid
EM 626 - Applied AI & Machine Learning for Systems and Enterprises and I'm going to take these courses this semester: 
EM 623 - Data Science and Knowledge Discovery
EM 624 - Data Exploration and Informatics for Engineering Management
EM 622 - Decision Making Via Data Analysis
SYS 611 - Systems Modeling and Simulation 
to build a strong foundation in modeling complex systems like power grids and learn applied AI for complex systems in areas like healthcare. In parallel, I am starting research by reviewing state-of-the-art OPF and healthcare solutions and identifying open challenges. Going forward, my aim is to work on developing a novel framework and applying it to problems of practical interest to grid operators/healthcare systems.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer and tennis and reading poems. I also like watching documentaries on science and nature.
