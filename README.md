Hi. My name is Saeid. I am a PhD student studying Systems Engineering at Stevens. My research and educational plans involve developing and solving optimization models for power system problems. In particular, I am interested in solving the complex AC optimal power flow problem using advanced algorithms that can handle non-convexity and scale to large real-world systems.
For my coursework, I am taking classes in decision and risk analysis, systems thinking, probabilistic methods, and simulation this year to build a strong foundation in modeling complex systems like power grids. In parallel, I am starting research by reviewing state-of-the-art OPF solutions and identifying open challenges. Going forward, my aim is to work on developing a novel optimization framework and applying it to problems of practical interest to grid operators.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer and tennis and reading poems. I also like watching documentaries on science and nature.
